### Matlab Implementation of sigclust2 (hierarchical sigclust)

This collection of Matlab functions provides an alternative implementation
to the R package, `sigclust2`. Functionality and design of most
methods are meant to be equivalent to those in the R package. However,
the R package should be assumed to be the more 'up-to-date' and
preferred implementation.

This package relies on several SigClust functions from the codebase of J.S. Marron,
